# Predictions Using Linear Regression
A Project using a demo Ecommerce dataset, to predict on the requirements by the Ecommerce org.

### Linear Regression
Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables. This sample project uses the basic procedures of simple linear regression to do the predictions.

### The Project Implementation
An Ecommerce company based that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. 
Remember that the Linear Regression is useful in relation to the continuous varaiables, not the discreate. If, suppose, our task would've been classification/binary classification based on the features of some kind, the Logistic Regression would be the best choice.
